In this project, I meticulously crafted a series of automated test cases to ensure seamless user experiences through every step of the purchasing journey 
𝟏. 𝐋𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐧 : Automated the login process to the Swag Labs website.
𝟐. 𝐀𝐝𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐭 : Implemented Selenium WebDriver to click on the "Add to   Cart" button, simulating item selection.
𝟑. 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐭 : Utilized automation to navigate to the cart page after adding items.
𝟒. 𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 : Automated the input of user details (name, address, zip code) and clicking on the "Continue" button.
𝟓. 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 : Used if-else statements to make sure the order went through and showed a Thank you for order message with displaying a message of appreciation for the purchase.

For locating and navigating the items or Functional Buttons I have used some of Selenium WebDriver Locators as Follows:
𝟏. 𝐈𝐃 : Used to Unique identify for an HTML element.
𝟐. 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐞 : Used to Selects elements based on their class attribute; 
𝟑. 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐞 : Used to Selects elements by their 'name' attribute;
𝟒. 𝐗𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐡 : Used for complex and flexible element selection.
𝟓. 𝐍𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐞.𝐭𝐨() method - Used for navigating to another page/window site.

Also used Synchronization Methods of Unconditional Statement as 𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝.𝐒𝐥𝐞𝐞𝐩() method for Used to stop the execution of the current thread
By Understanding Leveraging Selenium's capabilities, I executed test cases, handled dynamic elements, and verified expected outcomes, contributing to improved testing efficiency and accuracy.
